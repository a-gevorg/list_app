This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Why create-react-app
The main reason to choose CRA in our project is that Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications.

Webpack development server with watch & hot module reloading, optimised for React (ie allows CSS/Image/Font imports directly into components etc).
Server allows for proxying, so you can run it against an API on the same network (avoids CORS issues).
Always builds a progressive web app (ie builds the config for a service worker from the assets).
Test framework (Jest) + complete React integration working out of the box.
Already set up for Flow integration.
Full in-browser error overlay to aid in debugging.
All necessary Babel setup + transpiling of additional syntax changes at proposal stage that are relevant to React (object spread syntax + class property initializers + dynamic imports)
Githooks support built in
Builds fully production-ready aplications, all optimizations are included

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
